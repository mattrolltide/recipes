    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cranberries <em>[12 Ounces]<em>:</strong> This is self-explantory! You can't make cranberry sauce without cranberries.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar <em>[1 cup]</em></strong> This will add some sweetness to the sauce and also thicken it when it's heated.</li>
        <li><strong>Orange Juice <em>[1 cup]</em></strong> Cranberry Sauce needs a liquid base, but you can substitute this for pomegranate juice or red wine.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Dissolve the sugar in the orange juice(or the base of your choice) in a medium saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Stir in the cranberries and let them cook until they start to pop, this should take about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Remove the sauce from the heat and it should thicken as it cools.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Enjoy your delicious treat!</li>
    </ol>
